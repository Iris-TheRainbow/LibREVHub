# LibRevHub
A simple API for controlling REV Lynx Modules over USBSerial


## Whats the point?
Since FTC is going to stop using the REV LynxModule based control system, there will be thousands upon thousands of useless, realtively high quality, robotics
IO boards. This doesnt sit right with me, so I am attempting to implement the comms stack so that people can use these lynx modules for hobby robotics.
